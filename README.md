# Genetic Algorithms

## Implementation Overview

This repository contains C++ implementations of genetic algorithms, focusing on both binary and floating-point representations. Here's a brief overview of how each is implemented:

### Binary Genetic Algorithm

- **Encoding:** Solutions are represented as binary strings.
- **Selection:** Uses techniques like roulette wheel or tournament selection to choose parents.
- **Crossover:** Combines two parent solutions to create offspring, often using single-point or multi-point crossover.
- **Mutation:** Flips bits in the binary string to introduce variation.
- **Fitness Evaluation:** Measures how well each solution solves the problem, guiding the selection process.

### Floating Point Genetic Algorithm

- **Encoding:** Solutions are represented as arrays of floating-point numbers.
- **Selection:** Similar to the binary approach, selecting the best candidates for reproduction.
- **Crossover:** Blends parent solutions, often using arithmetic or uniform crossover.
- **Mutation:** Alters the floating-point values slightly to explore the solution space.
- **Fitness Evaluation:** Assesses the quality of solutions based on the problem's requirements.

### Common Features

- **Dataset Validation:** Ensures input data is suitable for processing.
- **Modular Design:** Each component (selection, crossover, mutation) is implemented as a separate module for flexibility.
- **Parameter Customization:** Allows easy adjustment of algorithm parameters like mutation rate and population size.

These implementations demonstrate the versatility of genetic algorithms in solving optimization problems by mimicking natural evolutionary processes.
